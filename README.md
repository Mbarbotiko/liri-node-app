# liri-node-app
This node app accepts the following user input:

spotify-this-song
my-tweets
movie-this
do-what-it-says

precede each command with:
node liri

if you are attempting to use this on your own PC you will need your own keys and secret for Twitter and Spotify API's.  
Mine are hidden in a .env file which you cannot see, you will need to supply your own. I am attaching a short video preview of this project.
